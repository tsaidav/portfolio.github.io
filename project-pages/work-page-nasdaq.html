	  <div class="body-text">Funnily enough, my first corporate role in the finance industry made me interested in tech (product in specific) and after my experiences through AWS and my personal projects I wanted to fully equip my product toolbelt with a software development role. Fortunately, many recruiters had reached out to me from all sorts of places, and I found myself at Nasdaq to complete my summer internship.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Now, while I had learnt and utilised many aspects of the tech stack used, this was my very first fully development role – allowing me to better understand the structure in which development teams operate and communicate, the different tech used at a market leader within the fintech industry and how to combat/mitigate various issues that arise when dealing with high-volume market data.</div>
