        <div class="subheader-text">Background</div>
        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The project started out as me completing online exercises in my own time to enhance my knowledge and get my hands dirty on Python programming and statistical analysis - leading me to a <a href="https://rpubs.com/natmurad/housepricesregression"><u>Regression Exercise</u></a> posted on RPubs by RStudio - predicting the selling price of residential properties based a number of factors.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Now, I've always been interested in properties and the statistics that lie behind them. As a kid, my parents and I would always go out to different property inspections across Sydney. This wasn't because we were looking to move or invest - it was just something we did to pass the time as a family on the weekends. Seeing different houses, seeing the different views and hearing the auctioneers rap out verses of different bids just seemed so cool as a kid - and so despite completing the exercise, something felt missing.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Recent news articles at the time of completing this project were heavily surrounded around housing affordability, changing interest rates and the common mistakes/misconceptions people made financing their first property. These articles inspired me to import data sets on Sydney properties and allow for users to input new data to accurately predict what the property they are interested in purchasing may end up costing, whilst simulatneously calculating the total amount they would need to repay based on current interest rates.</div>
